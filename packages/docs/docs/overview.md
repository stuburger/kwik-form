title: Yet. Another. Form. Library.
sidebar_label: Overview
--- 

Let's face it, form libraries are a dime a dozen. There's no shortage of options to choose from when picking out an abstration to help you with your daily form needs: there's `redux-form`, `formik`, `formsy-react`, `tcomb-form`, `react-form`, `react-final-form`... the list goes on. So what distinguishes **YAFL** from the rest? Yafl does some clever things under the hood (at least I think it does) but you don't - and shouldn't - care about any of that. Yafl tries to strike a balance between ergonomics, size, and performance. Yafl also aims to be the most playful form library on NPM!

## Motivation

I certainly didn't build Yafl because I saw the need for yet another form library. There are already a number of great implementations of form libraries in React, and I hope this is yet another addition to that list. So while the motivation for building this library was very much of the "eh, why not" variety (as opposed to the often touted "I saw a need for it" variety), I've have found Yafl extremely fun and flexible - even more so, I dare say, than the alternatives.

## Philosophy

Yafl's philosophy is to "keep it super simple". While it provides a lot of functionality out of the box, it aims to keep it's API surface area as small as possible while still remaining flexible and easy to use.

## Why use YAFL?

* Use TypeScript to create strongly typed forms that give you peace of mind and a good nights sleep. üò¥
* Structure your components to match the shape of your data. This means no more accessing field values using string paths! ü§Ø
* Deeply nested forms and forms within forms! üéÅ
* Render an Error! üò±
* Opt out of using Yafl's internal implementation by keeping track of your own form state and only use Yafl's context as a means to intelligently distribute state to your Fields! üöÄ
* Easily use third pary validation libraries like Yup - it just works!
* Flexible. üí™
* Fun. üòª

## Installation

```bash
npm i yafl --save
```

Or if you're using yarn
```bash
yarn add yafl
```

## Basic example

If you've used other form libraries most of this will feel familiar:

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { createFormContext } from 'yafl'

const { Form, Field, Section } = createFormContext()

function ExampleForm (props) {
  function handleSubmit(formValue) {
    console.log(formValue)
    // {
    //   fullName: '',
    //   contact: {
    //     email: '',
    //     address: {
    //       line1: '',
    //       postCode: ''
    //     }
    //   }
    // }
  }

  return (
    <Form initialValue={formData} onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {(yafl) => (
        <form onSubmit={yafl.submit}>
          <Field name="fullName" component="input" />
          <Section name="contact">
            <Field name="email" component="input" validate={validateEmail} />
            <Section name="address">
              <Field name="line1" component="input" />
              <Field name="postCode" component="input" />
            </Section>
          </Section>
          <button type="submit" disabled={!yafl.formIsDirty}>
            Submit Me!
          </button>
        </form>
      )}
    </Form>
  )
}
```
